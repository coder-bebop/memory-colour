# memory-challenge
The goal of this work sample is to construct a game called ”Colour Memory”. The game board consists of a 4x4 grid, all in all 16 slots. All slots consist of cards face-down. The player is to flip two of these upwards each round, trying to find equals. If the two cards are equal, the player receives one point, and the cards are removed from the game board. Otherwise, the player loses one point and the cards are turned face-down again. This continues until all pairs have been found. 

After the game is finished, the user would be required to input his/her name and email. User's details and scores would then be submitted to the database and the user would get notified with the highscores and his position in the score rankings.
